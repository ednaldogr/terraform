<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<h1>Welcome to Ed's nginx!</h1>
<p>If you see this page, the nginx web server was successfully installed by Ednaldo
using Terraform.</p>

<p>As always, for online documentation and support please refer to
<a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx.org</a>.<br/>
Commercial support is available at

<p>And... If you want to talk to Ednaldo, I would recomend a little patience...
He is quite busy, you know.</p>

<p><em>Thank you for using nginx.
And of course, hiring Ednaldo ;-)</em></p>
